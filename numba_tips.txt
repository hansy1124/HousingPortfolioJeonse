Numba Summary (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x58W9A2lnQc)

1) only use njit() - 'object mode' is not recommended

2) Do not use Python-list but use np.array - list leads to errors

3) If the numba can know what the type and length of argument will be, it is great for the speed

4) vectorize
- you can define a function in a scalar way, and 
- use it in vector way by using vectorize() 

5) from numba import prange
- this let you know whether you can use numba or not!
